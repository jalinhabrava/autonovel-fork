prompt = f"""Build a complete world bible for this fantasy novel. This is the WORLD.MD file -- 
the definitive reference for everything that EXISTS in this world. A writer should be able 
to resolve any worldbuilding question from this document alone.

SEED CONCEPT:
{seed}

VOICE IDENTITY (the tone and register of this novel):
{voice_part2}

CRAFT REQUIREMENTS (from CRAFT.md -- follow these):
- Magic system needs HARD RULES with COSTS and LIMITATIONS per Sanderson's Second Law
- Limitations >= powers in narrative prominence
- Trace implications of magic through society, economy, law, religion
- At least 2-3 societal implications of magic explored in depth
- History must create PRESENT-DAY TENSIONS that drive the plot (not just backdrop)
- Geography must be specific and sensory (not generic fantasy)
- Iceberg principle: imply more than you state
- Interconnection: pulling one thread should move everything

STRUCTURE THE DOCUMENT WITH THESE SECTIONS:

## Cosmology & History
A timeline of major events. Focus on events that create PRESENT-DAY tensions.
Include the founding myth, key turning points, and recent events that matter to the plot.

## Magic System
### Hard Rules
Specific, testable rules for the story's primary magic or speculative system.
What can be done, what the costs are, what the limits are, and what happens when rules break.

### Exceptional or Intuitive Phenomena
Any rarer, less formal, or more mysterious abilities that matter to the story.
Explain how they are perceived, what they cost, and what internal logic they follow.

### Societal Implications
How does tonal law shape: governance, commerce, education, class structure,
crime, family life, childhood, aging, disability?

## Geography
The core setting's physical layout, regions, and any defining environmental properties.
Neighboring places (at least 2-3). Sensory signatures for each location.

## Factions & Politics
Who holds power, who wants it, who's being crushed by it.
At least 3-4 factions with opposing interests.

## Bestiary / Flora / Natural World
What's unique about the natural world in and around the story's core setting?

## Cultural Details
Customs, taboos, festivals, food, clothing, coming-of-age rituals.
Things that make daily life feel SPECIFIC.

## Internal Consistency Rules
Hard constraints a writer must not violate. The physics of sound in this world.
What's possible and what's not.

IMPORTANT:
- Be SPECIFIC. Not "the city has districts" but name them, describe them, 
  give them sensory signatures.
- Every rule should have a COST or LIMITATION stated alongside it.
- Include 2-3 facts per section that are unexplained, hinting at deeper systems 
  (iceberg depth).
- Facts should INTERCONNECT: the magic should shape the politics, the geography 
  should shape the culture, the history should explain current faction conflicts.
- Write in clean, direct prose. No AI slop. No "rich tapestry." No "delving."
- The world should feel grounded and LIVED-IN, not imagined. Think: what does 
  breakfast smell like? What do children play? How do old people complain?
- Target ~3000-4000 words. Dense, not padded.
